**Meeting Notes – GlorpTech Unlimited + RubberPixel Studios**

**Date:** March 29, 2025  
**Attendee (GlorpTech):** Lila Navarro, Creative Director  
**Company Met:** RubberPixel Studios  
**Purpose:** Cross-studio collaboration for AR mobile campaign

**Summary:**
Lila met with RubberPixel’s concept and animation teams to discuss co-developing an interactive AR scavenger hunt app for a summer retail launch. RubberPixel is known for their stylized characters and wanted assurance that our asset pipeline could handle high-res models and motion capture workflows.

**Discussion Points:**
- Suggested using Unity with AR Foundation and Vuforia.
- Agreement reached on 60/40 revenue split favoring GlorpTech (we’ll handle publishing & backend).
- RubberPixel’s assets will require retopology and compression tuning for mobile optimization.
- Collaboration will use GitHub Actions + Trello for coordination.

**Risks Identified:**
- Tight deadline: Want to launch by June 1st.
- GlorpTech lacks in-house QA team — may need to contract testing externally.
- AR SDK license still pending renewal.

**Next Steps:**
- RubberPixel to submit initial concept sketches by April 2.
- Lila to finalize in-app store integration mockups.
- Weekly syncs every Thursday at 2 PM EST.

**Internal Note:**
RubberPixel’s work is solid, but we should watch their scope creep. Recommend setting feature freeze by May 10.
