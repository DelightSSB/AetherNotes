**CrimsonBank Digital Transformation Initiative: Core Banking Overhaul**

**1. Project Kickoff Summary**
The leadership team approved a full overhaul of CrimsonBankâ€™s core banking systems to enhance agility, digital customer experience, and fraud detection. Target completion: 18 months. Project will roll out in stages across three regions.

**2. Legacy System Limitations**
- Current COBOL-based system lacks support for real-time APIs.
- Batch processing delays inter-bank transactions.
- Incompatibility with mobile-first features and digital ID integrations.

**3. New Architecture Vision**
- Adopt a microservices-based architecture deployed via Kubernetes.
- Expose banking operations through secure REST APIs.
- Migrate databases from Oracle to PostgreSQL for scalability.

**4. Phased Implementation**
**Phase 1: API Infrastructure Setup**
- Deploy API gateways and authentication using OAuth 2.0.
- Sandbox environment setup for third-party fintechs.
- Train developers on OpenAPI documentation standards.

**Phase 2: Account Management Microservices**
- Break down monolithic account services into modules: KYC, transactions, ledger.
- Integrate with fraud analytics engine (using anomaly detection).

**Phase 3: Customer Experience Enhancements**
- Implement real-time alerts, chatbots, and biometric login for mobile apps.
- Migrate web interface to a responsive React-based frontend.

**5. Security & Compliance**
- Introduce DevSecOps pipeline with container vulnerability scanning.
- Continuous compliance testing for FFIEC and PCI-DSS standards.
- Enable geofencing and biometric controls for high-risk transactions.

**6. Risks and Dependencies**
- Legacy data migration complexity; risk of downtime.
- Dependency on third-party vendor SLAs for mobile middleware.
- Need for staff upskilling on containerization and microservices.

**7. Budget & ROI**
- Estimated budget: $9.4M over 18 months.
- Expected to reduce operational costs by 24% post Year 1.
- Projected customer churn decrease of 15% after rollout.

**8. Next Steps**
- Finalize vendor contract negotiations.
- Assign regional implementation leads.
- Draft internal change management communications.
