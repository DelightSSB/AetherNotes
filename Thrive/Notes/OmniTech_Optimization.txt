**OmniTech Data Center Optimization Project**

**1. Introduction**
OmniTech is launching a data center optimization initiative to improve performance and reduce costs. The current infrastructure operates on legacy hardware and is limited in scalability. The optimization project focuses on consolidating servers, upgrading storage systems, and implementing green computing practices.

**2. Server Consolidation**
- Migrate legacy servers to high-density blade servers.
- Decommission underutilized physical machines.
- Implement server virtualization using VMware.

**3. Storage System Upgrade**
- Replace aging NAS devices with SSD-based storage arrays.
- Introduce storage tiering to balance performance and cost.
- Enable backup redundancy with off-site disaster recovery.

**4. Green IT Initiatives**
- Deploy energy-efficient cooling and power systems.
- Monitor power usage effectiveness (PUE) across data centers.
- Educate staff on sustainable IT practices.

**5. Security & Monitoring**
- Upgrade physical access control systems.
- Implement centralized infrastructure monitoring tools.
- Conduct quarterly vulnerability assessments.

**6. Timeline**
**Q1:** Assess and plan upgrade roadmap.
**Q2:** Procure and install blade servers.
**Q3:** Upgrade storage and migrate data.
**Q4:** Final audit and performance testing.
