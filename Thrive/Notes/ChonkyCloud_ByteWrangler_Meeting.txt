**Attendee (ChonkyCloud):** Marcus Fenn, Sr. Integration Engineer  
**Company Met:** ByteWrangler Systems  
**Topic:** API Integration Partnership for Data Sync

**Overview:**
The meeting focused on the feasibility of integrating ByteWrangler’s real-time telemetry feed into ChonkyCloud’s FluffSync platform. ByteWrangler is seeking a long-term partner to offer cloud-based redundancy for their edge devices.

- Pilot integration to begin in May, focused on one data region (US-East).
- ChonkyCloud to draft a technical scope and initial resource forecast by April 18.

**Action Items:**
- Marcus to coordinate with DevOps on PoC architecture.
- ByteWrangler to send over schema documentation and rate limits.
- Joint follow-up scheduled for April 24.

**Marcus’s Comments:**
ByteWrangler’s CTO seems highly motivated and is already familiar with our containerized ingestion engine. This partnership could also open the door to direct sales leads from their manufacturing vertical.
